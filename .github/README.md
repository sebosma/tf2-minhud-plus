# MinHUD Plus
Makes the Minimal HUD look nicer by moving some stuff around, making things consistent and adding team-colored backgrounds to elements which previously had transparent backgrounds.
This HUD is a fork of, and is build upon, "[Community HUD Fixes](https://github.com/CriticalFlaw/tf2hud-fixes)" by CriticalFlaw. It is also inspired by "[Cheezy's Enhanced Minimal HUD Version 2](https://gamebanana.com/mods/26575)" by Cheezeh, and was made for personal use.  
Please report any bugs you encounter.

## Known Issues
- Voicechat and the voice chat indicator are obscured by the item counter and the canteen counter in MVM
